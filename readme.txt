Variations on the built-in admin color schemes. Shows visited links in a different color for easy tracking of dashboard news items not yet read.

== Description ==

This simple plugin adds two new WordPress admin color schemes. The colors are the same as the built-in *Blue* and *Grey* schemes, but with an additional color for visited links. This makes it easier to keep track of which dashboard news items you have and have not already read.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `admin-colors-plus-visited` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
1. Go to Users->Your Profile and select one of the new Admin Color Schemes in the Personal Options section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you choose that color for visited links? =

I used the same color the built-in color schemes use for when you hover over a link.

= Will this still work with WordPress versions 2.5 and 2.6? =

Nope, and it never will. You really should upgrade WordPress anyway to keep your site secure.

= What about WordPress 2.7 and up? =

It might work. I listed the plugin as requiring at least WordPress 3.0 because I have not tested older versions.
